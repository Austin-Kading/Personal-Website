<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>After working for over 10 years in the food service industry, I decided to shift my focus to a career in technology. While I was able to succeed and grow in my  previous career, I yearned for a greater challenge and the opportunity to make an impactful contribution to an organization. A passion for all things tech helped me decide to enroll in Dev Bootcamp in December 2016. As a  web developer, I bring with me an eagerness to learn and bring value to an organization with my knowledge base and skill set. I am a quick learner with an entrepreneurial spirit and innate curiosity. I pride myself on the soft skills that Iâ€™ve been able to acquire in my prior experiences.</p>
